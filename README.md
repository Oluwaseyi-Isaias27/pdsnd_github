# Bikeshare Project
### by [Idegbekwu Oluwaseyi](https://github.com/Oluwaseyi-Isaias27)
This is a Bikeshare Project created for Udacity's [Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104)

Description
-----------

This prjoject is built using Python. It focuses on pandas library usage and simple statistics methods to perform descriptive analysis on the bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City - to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.

### Running the program

Download the project locally on your computer. Extract the project and navigate to the project directory. Place the datasets in this directory.

Open either the terminal in Linux or command prompt in Windows in this location and type the following command.

```
python bikeshare.py
```
The program will execute


### Program Details

The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option).

Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (5 rows of data initially) or not. Following the input received, the program prints the following details:

* Most popular month
* Most popular day
* Most popular hour
* Most popular start station
* Most popular end station
* Most popular combination of start and end stations
* Total trip duration
* Average trip duration
* Types of users by number
* Types of users by gender (if available)
* The oldest user (if available)
* The youngest user (if available)
* The most common birth year amongst users (if available)

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.

Requirements
------------

* Language: Python 3.6 or above
* Libraries: numpy, pandas, time

Contents
--------
The contents of the project are:
* **bikeshare.py** - The main file to run this project

You can get the dataset for this project from the data folder. It contains data for three cities.
* **chicago.csv** - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Chicago provided by Udacity.

* **new_york_city.csv** - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of New York provided by Udacity.

* **washington.csv** - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Washington provided by Udacity. Note: This does not include the 'Gender' or 'Birth Year' data.

Built with
----------

* [Python 3.10.6](https://www.python.org/) - The language used to develop this.
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - One of the libraries used for this.
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - One of the libraries used for this.
* [time](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html) - One of the libraries used for this.

# Acknowledgements

* [pandas docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) - pandas documentation was immensely helpful in understanding the implemention of pandas methods used in this project.
* [Udacity](https://udacity.com) - Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program and their instructors were extremely helpful while I was pursuing this project.
* [philribbens](https://github.com/philribbens) - philribben's repository also added to better understanding of the structure for this project.
* [xhlow](https://github.com/xhlow) - xhlow's repository helped with understanding the structure and details of certain functions.
* Finally, I'd like to mention the _Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science_ book by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel. This book contain great depth on the knowledge of how to implement numpy and pandas methods that were used in this project.
